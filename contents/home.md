#### Biography

我叫翟王宇轩，是北京交通大学计算机科学与技术学院人工智能专业的本科生。目前，我在本校跟随[徐金安](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wMuW0W4AAAAJ&hl=en)教授和[黄锴宇](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qAp-hS4AAAAJ&hl=en)老师，开展自然语言处理（NLP）与地理领域交叉的相关研究 。

在2025年寒假期间，我参加了清华 AIR 的冬令营。在[李鹏](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=hgYzkOQAAAAJ)教授的指导下，我有幸得到了清华 AIR [王晓龙](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=p0jarqgAAAAJ)师兄以及北大软微[康兆璐](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Zhaolu_Kang2)师姐的宝贵指导 。

当下，我仍在持续深入地进行NLP与地理领域的相关研究，努力探索该交叉领域更多的可能性与应用前景 。

My name is Zhai Wangyuxuan, and I am an undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University. Currently, under the supervision of Professor [Xu Jin'an](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wMuW0W4AAAAJ&hl=en) and Teacher [Huang Kaiyu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qAp-hS4AAAAJ&hl=en) at my university, I am conducting research at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the field of geography.

During the winter vacation of 2025, I participated in the winter camp of Tsinghua AIR. Under the guidance of Professor [Li Peng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=hgYzkOQAAAAJ), I was fortunate enough to receive valuable guidance from [Wang Xiaolong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=p0jarqgAAAAJ) of Tsinghua AIR and [Kang Zhaolu]((https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Zhaolu_Kang2)) of Peking University Software and Microelectronics School.

At present, I am still continuously and deeply engaged in the research related to the NLP - geography field, striving to explore more possibilities and application prospects in this interdisciplinary field.
